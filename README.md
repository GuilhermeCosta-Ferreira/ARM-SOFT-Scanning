# üîé Scanning

## üìÉ 1. Description

A 3D Scanning Pipeline for the Amputee's Stump based on camera data to improve Robotic Arm socket confort. It is compromised of different tools:

1. A **Simulating Platform** on Blender
2. A **3D Reconstruction Pipeline** on Python

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. Simulating Platform

### 2.1. Contents

In this platform you will find:

- **add-ons/**: In this folder there is the list of needed blender add-ons to run the simuaton file. Inside you will find the add-on for **BlenderNeRF**. To understand how to use this pipeline resort to:
- **simulated_frames/**: In this folder tou will find various datasets of stump pictures that were generated with the blender simulating platform with varying number of degrees (cameras)
  - _dataset_d90.zip_ - Dataset of stump images taken with 90¬∫ degrees step (4 images)
  - _dataset_d60.zip_ - Dataset of stump images taken with 60¬∫ degrees step (6 images)
  - _dataset_d30.zip_ - Dataset of stump images taken with 30¬∫ degrees step (12 images)
- **3d_scanning_sim.blend**: In this file you will find the full enviroment used to generate the previous datasets

### 2.2. How Use?

To generate a new image first you will need to:

1. Load the BlenderNeRF add-on onto your blender enviroment: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install from Disk > `BlenderNeRF.zip`.
2. Configure your camera radius: CameraPath (object) > Item (Panel) > Dimensions and change both x and y dimensions to best fit your needs.
3. Configure your AABB to fit everything (camera and stump): AABB_Wire (Object) > Item (Panel) > Dimensions (x,y and z)
4. Configure your dataset general settings: BlenderNeRF (Panel) > BlenderNeRF shared UI <br>
   4.1. There you adjust the AABB size <br>
   4.2. Also check Render Frames and Save Logs as you will need both for the 3D Reconstruction <br>
   4.3. Select NeRF file format <br>
   4.4.efine the Save path
5. Configure your dataset specific settings: BlenderNeRF (Panel) > Subset of Frames SOF <br>
   5.1. Select the step value (the inbetween angle of every frame) <br>
   5.2. Update the dataset name
6. Run the Simualtion: BlenderNeRF (Panel) > Subset of Frames SOF >PLAY SOF
7. Run the script: `intrinsic.py` to extract the matrix K

## üñáÔ∏è Requirements

- If exterior software is used, is must be open source ‚Äî or at least easily accessible without constraints
- Simple scanning procedure, that doesn‚Äôt require very specific material
- The scan should be doable by a pair of two people (amputee and helper)
- End goal: Run the scanning algorithm on the mobile application

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

### Week 5 (Current Week):

- [x] To have a simulation platform that can generate stereo pictures (by defining a number of available angles)
  - [x] Learn to script in Blender
  - [x] Add the scene to Blender (with 3D stump)
  - [ ] Add the angle configuration to script
  - [x] Generate a 4 angle run
  - [x] Generate a 8 angle run
  - [x] Generate a 16 angle run
  - [x] Generate a 360 angle run

### <span style="color: darkred;"> ‚ö†Ô∏è Week 6:</span>

- [ ] Build the first algorithm
- [ ] Have the break to support with this, maybe the learning curve could limit this

### <span style="color: gray;"> Week 7:</span>

- [ ] Have a second algorithm with a comparison to pick the best
  - [ ] Maybe the first algorithm works more as a proof of concept
- [ ] Or start on the first physical prototype
  - [ ] Need to define multiple cameras or a rotating system

### <span style="color: gray;"> Week 8:</span>

- [ ] If went with 2 model -> start to build prototype
  - [ ] Most likely
  - [ ] Have the 3d model of the cameras mount
  - [ ] Have the cameras requested by now (and decided on the schema)
- [ ] If not -> Finish and refine prototype for PDR
  - [ ] May need 3d printing training, may be to generous of a deadline
